    "anchor": "disputes:pre-auth-vs-capture",
    "content_text": "A pre-authorization (pre-auth) is a hold placed on a customer's card before the final transaction is captured. This is common in hotels, car rentals, and gas stations. A capture happens when the merchant finalizes the charge. If a customer disputes a pre-auth hold, explain that the hold will expire automatically within 3-7 business days if not captured. If they dispute a captured transaction, initiate a formal chargeback process per network rules."

    "anchor": "cards:freeze-policy",
    "content_text": "Customers can freeze their card at any time through the mobile app or by calling support. A frozen card will decline all new transactions but will not affect recurring payments or pre-authorized transactions. To unfreeze a card, customers must verify their identity via OTP (one-time password). Cards remain frozen until the customer explicitly unfreezes them or replaces the card."

    "anchor": "transactions:reversal-process",
    "content_text": "Transaction reversals can occur for several reasons: merchant-initiated refunds, duplicate charges, or processing errors. Reversals typically appear in the customer's account within 3-5 business days. For international transactions, reversals may take up to 10 business days due to currency conversion and settlement delays. Customers should contact the merchant first for refunds before escalating to the bank."

Verify recent transactions and ask if they recognize suspicious activity. If fraud is confirmed, freeze the affected card immediately, initiate a card replacement, and file a fraud report. Document all customer responses in the case management system. Follow up within 24 hours with a summary of actions taken."

When a customer reports an incorrect balance, check for: 1) Pending transactions not yet posted, 2) Merchant holds (gas stations, hotels), 3) Recurring payments scheduled but not processed, 4) International transaction currency conversion delays. Use the transaction history API to pull a complete ledger and reconcile manually if needed."

LVL_2 requires government-issued ID and proof of address. LVL_3 requires enhanced due diligence including income verification and source of funds documentation.

Customers must file disputes within these timeframes or they forfeit their right to challenge the transaction. For international disputes, add 30 additional days. Always document the dispute date and ensure it falls within the allowed window."

Currency conversion happens automatically when a customer makes a transaction in a currency they don't hold. Conversion rates are updated hourly and include a 1.5% markup.

Notify customers immediately on the first failure and provide options to update payment method or fund the account. After 3 failed attempts, the recurring payment is cancelled and the merchant is notified."
